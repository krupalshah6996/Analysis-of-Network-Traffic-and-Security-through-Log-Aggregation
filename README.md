# Analysis-of-Network-Traffic-and-Security-through-Log-Aggregation
The research paper for this project has been published: https://www.slideshare.net/IJCSISResearchPublic/analysis-of-network-traffic-and-security-through-log-aggregation
Detection of network vulnerability and loop holes via collection and analysis of various logs, developed scripts for useful data parsing.
Developed a program in Python to generate real-time alerts for network administrator in scenarios of attacks and maliciousness, for data protection and prevention.
With open source ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) software, performed search and analysis of data from multiple sources, enabled server-side data processing pipeline that ingests and transforms data which is stored in a stash.
Created a user-friendly and interactive dashboard for analysis and geo-identifying each log.
